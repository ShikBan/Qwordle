# Qwordle
IBM QChack22 Challenge

We present here the quantum version of the very popular game - "wordle", which is based on Grover's algorithm. We define it as "Qwordle". The quest of this game is two fold: (1) both human and quantum computer will be guessing a randomly picked word and (2) they will compete against each other based on the time it takes both of them to guess the word correctly and independently. As an added feature to our game we have created two different levels, beginner and expert, based on the difficulty of a word. For simplicity, here we have considered all 3 letter words in the beginner category and all 5 letter words in the expert category. The dataset for 3 letter and 5 letter words were obtained from kaggle.
